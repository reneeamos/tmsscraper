Ever tried to deviate from the sample plan of study for your major at Drexel University in any way shape or form? Fellow masochist, this project is (well, will be) for you. 

I am writing a tool that will scrape the Term Master Schedule (https://termmasterschedule.drexel.edu) for the courses offered each quarter. It will then store individual course data with the term it collected it from and offer an improved search to the one offered on the TMS site. The user will ideally be able to:
* Enter a course code and see the terms it is offered
* Enter a course code and view the prerequisite chain for that course
* Upload syllabi to courses they have taken and view syllabi for courses they hope to take
* idk ill come up with more stuff to make it unique
